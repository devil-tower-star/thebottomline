<p class="questions">what cause are you passionate about?</p>
<ul>
  <li>workers rights &#9994;</li>
  <ul>
  <li>ensuring people can access the resources they need to live</li>
  <li>reinforcing safeguards against exploitation in the workplace</li>
  <li>holding corporations and wealthy individuals accountable for the damage they cause</li>
  <li>deconstructing the anti-labor biases of mainstream media</li>
</ul>


</ul>
<br>
<p class="questions">how did you come to care about your cause?</p>
<ul>
  <li>well at some point i learned that the economic system we live under is called capitalism and when i got older i realized that it sucks</li>
  <li>i think it's ridiculous that a small percentage of the US' population holds most of the country's wealth. that as well as adjacent issues such as what billionaires will do to maintain and grow their wealth and how that affects everyone else makes me so angry</li>
<li>it might also be worth restating a commonly known fact that money has grown to be inexplicably tied with several other aspects of life, such as politics and the environment, both of which are severely affected by the pursuit for wealth. additionally, by putting a strain on the resources and time available to workers, people are often forced to pick between organizing politically and paying for necessities, which prevents collective action.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p class="questions">what actions is the NPS taking to address or support your cause?</p>
<ul>
  <li>the NPS creates programs that are widely accessible and connect people to resources available through national parks(as well as connect people with one another). these opportunities teach people, especially youth, about sustainability and the nation's culture and history, and empowers them by involving them with current efforts relating to environmental and social justice.</li>
  <li>through the connections and influence the NPS has as a government agency, it is also able to coordinate with other organizations and groups to create a wider network of resources for people to access and contribute to. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p class="questions">what would you like to see the NPS do to better address or support your cause?</p>
<ul>
  <li>federal programs are supposed to be administered in a 'nonpartisan fashion'. it's also generally considered important to maintain a professional attitude and conform to standard english when communicating publicly. this can detract from the emotional impact and urgency of messages about current events and the environment. it also limits who can share their voice because through circumstances such as language barriers or cultural differences, people won't always be able to communicate in a way that conforms to public speaking etiquette. while being nonpartisan is important to ensure everyone's being treated fairly, the NPS should continue to also firmly and vocally show its support for ongoing movements that would improve living conditions nationally and globally. relating specifically to the cause i mentioned above, i would like to see support for unions and labor movements especially as workers go on strike in record numbers this summer.</li>
<li>with that being said, the NPS has invited many guest speakers to talk and share their perspective on a wide range of subjects, which has helped to remedy this. assuming that the NPS is less influenced by wealthy donors than other groups, it should take advantage of that freedom to broadcast messages that are stifled or censored because of "unfavorable" ideas. this ties into the earlier bullet point of holding corporations and wealthy individuals accountable for their actions.</li>
<ul>
  <li>the IMBY crew went to the wing luke museum on thursday and one thing we learned was how currently downtown bellevue is built on farmland stolen from japanese americans incarcerated during world war two. we also learned about how the freeman family, who currently owns a ton of downtown bellevue, worked with the city of bellevue to continuously remove all mentions with the family's racism. the NPS helps share stories about japanese americans displaced by executive order 9066 through memorials and opportunities to talk with experts, and the issue with the freemans is an example of a story that would not have been told anywhere else.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<br>
<p class="questions">what does your ideal future look and feel like, and how do national parks fit into that vision?</p>
<ul>
  <li>it'd be nice to live in a world where our lives aren't controlled by corporate interests</li>
  <li>the future looks really bleak right now &#128512; and it can be exhausting to think about because it's going to take a long time for conditions to improve. national parks create a space that connects people together and decreases some of the isolation felt as a result of living in a world that's becoming more hostile towards the people living in it.</li>
