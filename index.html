<p style="width:520px; left:20px;">They're destroying native forests and they're poisoning our seas,</p>

<p style="width:460px; left:300px;">Cos money doesn't need to eat and capital don't breathe,</p>

<p style="width:530px; left:850px; top:300px;">When there's nothing more to plunder, well that will be just fine,</p>

<p style="width:540px; left:1500px; top:80px;">Cos there'll be nothing left but money and that's their bottom line.</p>

<p style="width:420px; left:2300px; bottom:230px;">Seems labour is enslaved as long as capital is free,</p>
